# U-Net from scratch

This repository is inspired by [DigitalSreeni](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34rW-HtPJulxr5wp2Xa04w/about)'s awesome 
[YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYJ81M58y8&t).

The difference is that this repository uses PyTorch instead of TensorFlow and Keras.

Usage:

```commandline
python run_unet.py
```

PNG images for individual batches and epochs (e.g., `epoch001_batch001`) are saved into the `images_training` directory.
